## Project One: Guessing Game
This project involved getting the basic of Python like commenting, printing, and getting used to the variables. In this project I created a guessing game where you input a lower and upper bounds for the range of numbers you want to guess in. Afterwards, you get five guesses with each guess telling you if you were too high or too low.
