## SolidWorks Project

In my sophomore year at Rose-Hulman I took a CAD class and part of the class was creating something we found interesting. I decided to create a model of my acoustic
guitar. I had a lot of fun doing small details on the guitar like the wood lining inside the guitar and creating the frets. I learned a lot of the nuances of SolidWorks
with this project as well.
