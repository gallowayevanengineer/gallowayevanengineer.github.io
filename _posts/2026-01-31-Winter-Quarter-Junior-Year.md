# Why Add?
I like documenting my engineering journey and figured it would be perfect to add all the stuff I did this quarter. I was in a lot of project classes so this
was the first time I was exposed to a lot of real applications and not just theoretical homeworks.
## Design For Manufacturing Projects
### Context
Design for Manufacturing or (DFM) exposed me to a ton of different manufacturing processes. This class was super project heavy and gave me lots of hands on
experience with all kinds of processes from sandcasting to thermoforming.

#### Sandcasting Project
For the first group project in this class we created a CAD model of a trophy before printing it out and then sandcasting it.

#### Stamping Project
Everyone in class was assigned to create a design that could meet the specifications our professor asked of us. Here is our design

#### Welding Project

#### Thermoforming Project
My class made thermoforming designs in CAD and then a handful were selected to thermoform for real and make chocolates!
The group I was in chose to design a Batman logo and it sadly did not win.

Here is our CAD model as well.

## Measurement Systems Projects
### Context
Measurement Systems exposed me to a variety of different tools and sensors used in engineering practice and taught me about their uncertainties.

#### Finding a Shear Modulus
My group was tasked with finding the Shear Modulus of an Apparatus. Attached is our project results.

#### Designing an Appartus
For my groups second project we were assigned to theoretically design and create an apparatus with the uncertainties accounted for.

## Digital Systems Projects
### Context
#### Pong Game

## Materials Projects
### Context
#### Comparing Regular vs Annealed Material
