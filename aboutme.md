My name is Evan Galloway, and I am a current Junior Mechanical Engineer at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology.

The website itself and other projects found, are passion projects of mine and I do them for fun. However, I do realize that they can represent a great portfolio as well. By showcasing my portfolio on here, I hope to show my curiosity, self-learning, and passion for engineering.  

If you would like to contact me please go back to the website home page and scroll to the bottom to find my contact info.
